### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#50](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/50) fixes the `Halresource` constructor documentation of the `$embedded`
  argument to correctly be an array of `HalResource` arrays (and not just an
  array of `HalResource` instances).

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#41](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/41) fixes how `null` values in resources are handled when rendering as XML.
  Previously, these would lead to an `InvalidResourceValueException`; now they
  are rendered as content-less tags.

## 1.1.0 - 2018-06-05

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#39](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/39) adds a cookbook recipe detailing how to create a fully contained, path-segregated
  module, complete with its own router, capable of generating HAL resources.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#39](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/39) updates `LinkGeneratorFactory` to allow passing an alternate service name to use when
  retrieving the `LinkGenerator\UriGeneratorInterface` dependency.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#39](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/39) updates `ResourceGeneratorFactory` to allow passing an alternate service name to use when
  retrieving the `LinkGenerator` dependency.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#37](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/37) modifies
  `HalResource` to no longer treat empty arrays as embedded collections when
  passed via the constructor or `withElement()`. If an empty embedded collection
  is required, use `embed()` with a boolean third argument to force
  representation as an array of resources.

## 1.0.1 - 2018-03-28

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#36](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/36)
  fixes an issue whereby query string arguments were not being added to
  links generated for a resource. It now correctly merges those specified in
  metadata with those from the request when generating links.

## 1.0.0 - 2018-03-15

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#31](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/31) changes
  the constructor signature of `Mezzio\Hal\HalResponseFactory` to read:

  ```php
  public function __construct(
      callable $responseFactory,
      Renderer\JsonRenderer $jsonRenderer = null,
      Renderer\XmlRenderer $xmlRenderer = null
  )
  ```

  Previously, the `$responseFactory` argument was a
  `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $responsePrototype`; it is now a PHP
  callable capable of producing a new, empty instance of that type.

  Additionally, the signature previously included a callable `$streamFactory`;
  this has been removed.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#31](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/31) updates
  the `HalResponseFactoryFactory` to follow the changes made to the
  `HalResponseFactory` constructor. It now **requires** that a
  `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` service be registered, and that the
  service resolve to a `callable` capable of producing a `ResponseInterface`
  instance.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.6.3 - 2018-03-12

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#32](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/32) modifies
  `HalResponseFactoryFactory` to test if a `ResponseInterface` service instance
  is `callable` before returning it; if it is, it calls it first. This allows
  the `ResponseInterface` service to return a response _factory_ instead of an
  instance.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.6.2 - 2018-01-03

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#27](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/27) modifies
  the `XmlRenderer` to raise an exception when attempting to render objects that
  are not serializable to strings.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#27](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/27) adds
  handling for `DateTime` and string serializable objects to the `XmlRenderer`,
  allowing them to be rendered.

## 0.6.1 - 2017-12-12

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#26](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/26) adds
  support for the mezzio-helpers 5.0 series of releases.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.6.0 - 2017-11-07

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#23](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/23) modifies
  how the resource generator factory adds strategies and maps metadata to
  strategies. It now adds the following factories under the
  `Mezzio\Hal\Metadata` namespace:

  - `RouteBasedCollectionMetadataFactory`
  - `RouteBasedResourceMetadataFactory`
  - `UrlBasedCollectionMetadataFactory`
  - `UrlBasedResourceMetadataFactory`

  Each implements a new `MetadataFactoryInterface` under that same namespace
  that accepts the requested metadata type name and associated metadata in order
  to create an `AbstractMetadata` instance. Metadata types are mapped to their
  factories under the `mezzio-hal.metadata-factories` key.

  Strategies are now configured as metadata => strategy class pairings under the
  `mezzio-hal.resource-generator.strategies` key.

  In both cases, defaults that mimic previous behavior are provided via the
  `ConfigProvider`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.5.1 - 2017-11-07

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#21](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/21) fixes the
  `LinkGeneratorFactory` to properly use the
  `Mezzio\Hal\LinkGenerator\UrlGeneratorInterface` service when
  creating and returning the `LinkGenerator` instance. (0.5.0 was incorrectly
  attempting to use the `UrlGenerator` service, which does not exist.)

## 0.5.0 - 2017-10-30

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#20](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/20) renames
  the following interfaces and traits to have `Interface` and `Trait` suffixes,
  respectively; this was done for consistency with existing Laminas packages. (Values
  after the `:` retain the namespace, which is omitted for brevity.)

  - `Mezzio\Hal\LinkGenerator\UrlGenerator`: `UrlGeneratorInterface`
  - `Mezzio\Hal\Renderer\Renderer`: `RendererInterface`
  - `Mezzio\Hal\ResourceGenerator\Strategy`: `StrategyInterface`
  - `Mezzio\Hal\ResourceGenerator\ExtractCollection`: `ExtractCollectionTrait`
  - `Mezzio\Hal\ResourceGenerator\ExtractInstance`: `ExtractInstanceTrait`

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#16](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/16) renames
  the various `Exception` interfaces to `ExceptionInterface`, in order to be
  consistent with other Laminas packages.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

## 0.4.3 - 2017-10-30

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#19](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/19) fixes the
  behavior of `ResourceGenerator` when nesting a collection inside another
  resource to properly nest it as an array of items, rather than a collection
  resource.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#18](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/18) fixes the
  return type hint of `RouteBasedResourceMetadata::setRouteParams()` to correctly
  be `void`.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/13) updates
  `ExtractCollection::extractPaginator()` to validate that the pagination
  parameter is within the range of pages represented by the paginator instance;
  if not, an `OutOfBoundsException` is raised.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/12) fixes how pagination
  metadata (`_page`, `_page_count`, `_total_items`) is represented in generated
  resources, ensuring values are cast to integers.

## 0.4.2 - 2017-09-20

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#7](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/7) fixes a number of issues in
  the various exception implementations due to failure to import classes
  referenced in typehints.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#6](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/6) fixes a number of docblock
  annotations to reference `HalResource` vs `Resource` (which is a reserved
  word).

## 0.4.1 - 2017-08-08

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#6](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-hal/pull/6) fixes an issue with the XML
  renderer when creating resource elements that represent an array.

## 0.4.0 - 2017-08-08

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- The package name was changed to "zendframework/zend-expressive-hal".
- The namespace was changed from `Hal` to `Zend\Expressive\Hal`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.3.0 - 2017-08-07

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#4](https://github.com/weierophinney/hal/pull/4) adds the ability to force
  both links and embedded resources to be rendered as collections, even if the
  given relation only contains one item.

  To force a link to be rendered as a collection, pass the attribute
  `__FORCE__COLLECTION__` with a boolean value of `true` (or use the constant
  `Link::AS_COLLECTION` to refer to the attribute name).

  To force an embedded resource to be rendered as a collection, pass a boolean
  `true` as the third argument to `embed()`. Alternately, pass an array
  containing the single resource to any of the constructor, `withElement()`, or
  `embed()`.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.2.0 - 2017-07-13

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#1](https://github.com/weierophinney/hal/pull/1) adds a `Hal\Renderer`
  subcomponent with the following:
  - `Renderer` interface
  - `JsonRenderer`, for creating JSON representations of `HalResource` instances.
  - `XmlRenderer`, for creating XML representations of `HalResource` instances.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#1](https://github.com/weierophinney/hal/pull/1) changes `Hal\HalResponseFactory`
  to compose a `JsonRenderer` and `XmlRenderer`, instead of composing
  `$jsonFlags` and creating representations itself.

  It also makes the response prototype and the stream factory the first
  arguments, as those will be the values most often injected.

  The constructor signature is
  now:

  ```php
  public function __construct(
      Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $responsePrototype = null,
      callable $streamFactory = null,
      Hal\Renderer\JsonRenderer $jsonRenderer = null,
      Hal\Renderer\XmlRenderer $xmlRenderer = null
  ) {
  ```

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-hal#1](https://github.com/weierophinney/hal/pull/1) changes `Hal\HalResponseFactoryFactory`
  to comply with the new constructor signature of `Hal\HalResponseFactory`. It
  also updates to check for `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` and
  `Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface` services before attempting to use
  laminas-diactoros classes.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

## 0.1.6 - 2017-07-12

### Added

- Adds keywords to the `composer.json`
- Adds a "provides" section to the `composer.json` (provides PSR-13 implementation)
- Adds `composer.json` suggestions for:
  - PSR-11 implementation
  - laminas-paginator

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.1.5 - 2017-07-12

  https://weierophinney.github.io/hal/

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.1.4 - 2017-07-12

### Added

- Adds the method `templatedFromRoute()` to the `LinkGenerator` class. Acts
  exactly like `fromRoute()`, but the generated `Link` instance will have the
  `isTemplated` property toggled `true`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.1.3 - 2017-07-11

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Fixes registration of the `MetadataMap` in the `ConfigProvider`; it was
  previously using an incorrect namespace.

## 0.1.2 - 2017-07-11

### Added

- Adds `HalResponseFactoryFactory`, a factory for generating a
  `HalResponseFactory` instance.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.1.1 - 2017-07-11

### Added

- Adds the ability to inject route params and query string arguments at run-time
  to the route-based metadata instances.

  When dealing with route-based metadata, we may be dealing with
  sub-resources; in such cases, the route parameters may be derived from
  the request, and we will want to inject them at run-time.

  When dealing with collections, the query string arguments may indicate
  things such as searches, sort directions, sort columns, filters, limits,
  etc.; these will be derived from the request, and need to be injected at
  run-time.
